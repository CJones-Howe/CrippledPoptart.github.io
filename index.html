 <h1>Passion for Video Games</h1>
 <p> Video games are usually really fun but they cost a lot of money. Despite costing a lot of money its cool to use. My favorit type of video games are FPS type game. This includes Call of Duty, Battlefield etc. </p>
 <h2> Call of Duty </h2>
 <p> Call of Duty was made in 2004 or 5 I forgot but it's been out for a very long time. Games like <br> Black Ops <br> Modern Warfare <br> World at War. <br> These games are some of the most popular games made by Activision. </p>
 <h3> This was fun to make </h3>
