      Planets are massive, naturally occurring celestial bodies that orbit a star — in our solar system, that’s the Sun. They form from clouds of gas and dust in space, pulled together by gravity over millions of years. As planets form, their composition and position in the solar system determine whether they become rocky terrestrial planets like Earth, or gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Understanding the origins of planets helps scientists piece together how solar systems evolve and whether life might exist beyond Earth.

    <p>
      Each planet in our solar system is unique in size, orbit, temperature, rotation speed, and atmosphere. For example, Venus spins backwards compared to other planets, and Jupiter is so massive it protects Earth from many asteroid impacts. Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, while smaller rocky planets like Mercury and Mars have solid surfaces and thin or no atmospheres. Some planets have dozens of moons, while others have complex ring systems or magnetic fields that dwarf Earth’s.

      Scientists and astronomers study planets not only to understand how the solar system works, but also to answer questions about our origins and future. Could other planets support life? Could humans colonize them? Missions like the Mars Rovers, the Juno mission to Jupiter, and the James Webb Space Telescope continue to collect data that pushes the limits of what we know. As technology advances, planets are no longer just distant lights in the sky — they’re becoming our next frontier.
