            <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide prevalent on its surface. It is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, approximately 1/100th the density of Earth's, and has a surface gravity about 38% of Earth's. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped.</p>

            <p>The planet's surface features include polar ice caps, canyons, and volcanoes, with Olympus Mons being the largest volcano and highest known mountain in the solar system. Evidence suggests that Mars once had a much thicker atmosphere and was warmer, with liquid water existing on its surface, leading to ongoing scientific interest in the possibility of past or present microbial life.</p>

            <h3>5 Fun Facts About Mars</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system, which can sometimes engulf the entire planet and last for months.</li>
                <li>A Martian day, or sol, is only slightly longer than an Earth day, lasting about 24 hours and 37 minutes.</li>
                <li>The planet has distinct seasons due to its axial tilt, similar to Earth's, resulting in variations in temperature and weather patterns.</li>
                <li>Several robotic missions, including rovers and orbiters, have explored Mars, gathering data and images to study its geology, climate, and potential for habitability.</li>
                <li>Evidence from these missions suggests the presence of subsurface water ice and potential for past or present water activity, fueling speculation about the possibility of finding evidence of life on Mars.</li>
