        <div class="info-box bio"> 
            <p>I am a cybersecurity student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity with a minor in Machine Learning and Game Development at the University at Albany. I have consistently maintained strong academic performance, earning a place on the Deanâ€™s List, while building practical skills through coursework, hands-on homelab projects, and leadership roles. I am passionate about cybersecurity and committed to continuous learning, especially in areas like system administration, network security, and threat detection.</p>
            <p>Alongside my academic journey, I serve as the Blue Team Co-Captain for the Cyber Defense Organization, where I lead workshops, mentor new members, and compete in red vs. blue team competitions. These experiences have allowed me to strengthen my technical skills in Linux and Windows hardening, incident response, and the use of cybersecurity tools like Wazuh, pfSense, and Splunk. I also enjoy building Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, particularly focused on cryptography, which helps sharpen my problem-solving and creative thinking abilities.</p>
            <p>Beyond technical work, I value leadership and communication. As a former World Representative, I helped organize events and assist fellow students, which helped me develop strong teamwork and interpersonal skills. I take pride in balancing technical knowledge with leadership experience, and I am excited to continue growing into a well-rounded cybersecurity professional.</p>
