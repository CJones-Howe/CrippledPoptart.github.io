            <p>Hello, my name is Zion Smith-Fox. I am a cybersecurity student at the University at Albany. I like to play video games, go for walks, make personal projects, and hopefully soon learn more about making music. I am currently in a leadership role for the Great Dane Defense Organization (CDO) on campus. We primarily teach students about defending their computers, systems, and anything practical. We have a large alumni network that works in huge companies such as CrowdStrike, Google, Apple, and even Microsoft. This club is going to benefit me in the long run. I was also able to get a summer internship as an IT Help Desk Intern in NYC.</p>
