            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite.</p>
            <p>About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by waterâ€”mostly by oceans, but also including lakes, rivers, and other freshwater. The remaining 29% is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that slowly migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years.</p>
